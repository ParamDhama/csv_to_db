## Introduction

The CSV to Database Conversion Project is a Python script that enables you to effortlessly convert CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files into a SQLite database. This tool is particularly useful for managing and analyzing tabular data efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have the required software and libraries installed:

1. **Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
   pip install pandas

### Running the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd path/to/csv_to_db_project

3. Run the conversion script:
   python main.py

The script will read the `data.csv` file from the `data/` directory and convert it into an SQLite database named `data.db`.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the script using the `config.ini` configuration file located in the `config/` directory. The `config.ini` file allows you to set various options, including the database name and other configuration parameters.

Example `config.ini` content:

[Database]
database_name = ../data/data.db

## Advanced Usage

### Additional Features

The CSV to Database Conversion Project offers several additional features that you can explore and enhance:

- **Data Validation and Transformation**: Extend the `converter.py` module to implement data validation and transformation functions, allowing you to clean and format the data before storing it in the database.

- **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**: Create an interactive command-line interface using libraries like `argparse` or `click` to provide users with intuitive options for specifying CSV files, database names, and table names.

- **Data Visualization**: Integrate data visualization libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly` to generate graphical representations of your data stored in the database.

- **Data Backup and Restore**: Implement data backup and restore functionality to safeguard your data. This could involve creating backup copies of the database files and enabling users to restore data from these backups.

### Unit Tests

The project includes a set of unit tests in the `tests/` directory. These tests help ensure the correctness of the various components of the project.

To run the tests:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd path/to/csv_to_db_project

3. Run the following command:
   python -m unittest discover tests

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the script or the project, refer to the troubleshooting section in the `README.md` file for common solutions and workarounds.
